## Classes

**Class** 
    
    Clases are the blueprint on which objects are  created.
    Forms the base of Java, which is driven on objects.

**Inner Class** 

    We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable. Additionally, it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.

**Static Inner Class** 

    It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.
