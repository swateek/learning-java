# Learning Java

Contains code snippets written in Java. For my personal learning endeavors, could help you as well.

#### I have used vscode to work with these snippets

The code has been divided into section, all realted to Java.

    * **CoreJavaSnippets** ~ elaborates on Core Java concepts. 
    * **AdvanceJavaConcepts** ~ moved deeper into Java territory, to the trickier parts.
    * **DesignPatterns** ~ talks about variety of design patterns, not exhaustive.
