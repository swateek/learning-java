## Factory Design Pattern

[Details are Here.](https://howtodoinjava.com/design-patterns/creational/implementing-factory-design-pattern-in-java/)

    Factory pattern introduces loose coupling between classes which is the most important principle one should consider and apply while designing the application architecture. Loose coupling can be introduced in application architecture by programming against abstract entities rather than concrete implementations. This not only makes our architecture more flexible but also less fragile.
